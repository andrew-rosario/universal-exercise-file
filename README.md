# (U)niversal (E)xercise (F)ile
#### Creating a standard for exercise movements for fitness applications and other uses.

## Inspiration
I am a fitness enthusiast. I'm also a technology person as well. Thus, it was no surprise that I integrated technology into my fitness routines. It first started with Fitbod, a popular fitness app that generated workouts depending on your muscle recovery. But one year later, I decided to switch to SmartGym.

When that happened, I lost all of that fitness data in Fitbod. That included repetitions, sets, personal records, streaks, you name it. It didn't bother me at the time, but I know some people might feel bummed to essentially "start over".

Well, it is now that time, and I've switched to another app, Hevy. It is essentially Strong 2.0. But the same issue persists. I cannot move my SmartGym data into it and it is essentially starting over from scratch.

In SmartGym, I made routines specifically for splits and muscle group days. Naturally, I replicated that in Hevy. But what I noticed are two things: Commonality and Differences.

Commonality, that is, a lot of exercises exist in both apps and so I could easily recreate the routines.

But Differences also existed. That is, some exercises in SmartGym didn't exist in Hevy, so I couldn't transfer them over. Hevy does allow you to "create" exercises in the app, but I generally try not to do this. You never know when the developers might add that exercise into the future, and in some respects, I rather go blind and start "clean" when it eventually enters the app, if at all.

This got me thinking... Why isn't there a universal database for exercise routines? I mean, they all follow a similar format, right? Some involve repetitions. Some are time based. All of these exercises could log personal records. They all contain some instructions, like pictures, animations, or perhaps a YouTube video. Basically, I was thinking, "If there was a universal standard for exercises, you can simply load these files into any apps and they would just 'understand them'".

I was thinking of this standard like "exercise cards" which contain the movement and how to do them. Except these files will be a lot richer in data.

So that's the concept.

## Features
- Basic metadata (name, muscle group, necessary equipment)
- Rich media support, such as pictures, GIFs, 3D models, and videos, either contained in-file or external link.
- Detailed instructions area.
- Optional database storage; store workout history, personal records, volume, repetitions performed, sets done, etc.
- If previous, able to compute analytics over span of time using data
